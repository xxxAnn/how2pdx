# Getting Started

First, [this](https://vic3.paradoxwikis.com/Modding) wiki article is a *must* read. You should go read it now.

Now that you're back, we can start talking about modding, programming knowledge will be helpful, and I will be making multiple comparison to other languages (especially LUA). However it is not necessary and this guide hopes to make you learn programming as you learn how to code PDX mods and just how to code in general.

We'll start by going over the concept of a game loop, then we'll describe [On Actions], followed by [Effects] and [Triggers]. Next we'll go over [Scripted Types and Content] and then[Scopes] and [Targets]. Finally we'll touch on [Localization] and [GUI]. 

All throughout this, we will be working on a fun little system that allows us to send our IG leaders on Diplomatic Missions to foreign countries.
